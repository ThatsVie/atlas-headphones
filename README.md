For the first task, we created the header and hero section of the webpage.

**HTML**

Header: Includes a logo and navigation links ("What We Do", "Our Results", "Contact Us").

Hero Section: Contains a headline, subheadline, call-to-action button, and a descriptive paragraph.

**CSS**

Variables that define colors, font sizes, and other reusable values.

Base styles set up universal box-sizing, font family, and link styles.

Style the header, logo, and navigation links for different screen sizes.

Style the hero section with background image, text alignment, and spacing.

In this task, we created the "What We do..." section, which highlights key features using custom font icons.

**HTML**

We structured the HTML to include a heading, a description, and four feature blocks. Each feature block contains a custom font icon, a heading, and a description.

**CSS**

We updated the CSS to style the "What We do..." section, ensuring it is responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. The CSS includes styles for the section container, text blocks, and feature blocks, as well as media queries for responsiveness.


### Task 3:

![our results pug](https://github.com/ThatsVie/atlas-headphones/assets/143755961/f620327a-aa93-470b-95bf-03c469a5deea)

For this task, we created the "Our Results" section. The section showcases a background image and pentagon-shaped highlights for the metrics.

**HTML Updates**

The HTML structure for the "Our Results" section includes a container for the section's text and a container for the result blocks. Each result block is styled to maintain a consistent pentagon shape across various screen sizes.

**CSS Updates**

The CSS for the "Our Results" section ensures that the pentagon shapes maintain their form across different screen sizes. This is achieved using a combination of flexbox for layout and careful dimensioning of the result blocks.

### Task 4:

![contact pug](https://github.com/ThatsVie/atlas-headphones/assets/143755961/34a9b5d7-cfe5-408d-ab7d-2d3e1e9ac525)

In this task, we added a "Contact Us" section to the webpage. This section includes a form where users can input their name, email, and a message. 
**HTML Updates**

The HTML structure for the "Contact Us" section includes a `<section>` element with a form inside it. The form has three input fields for "Name," "Email," and "Your message," each wrapped in a `<div>` with the class `form-group`. The input fields have placeholders for guidance, and there is a submit button labeled "CALL TO ACTION."

**CSS Updates**

The CSS for the "Contact Us" section centers its content and sets an appropriate height. The form layout is flexible and responsive, ensuring it is centered and evenly spaced. Input fields are styled for a clean look, and media queries adjust the layout for different screen sizes, maintaining a cohesive design across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

### Task 5: 

![footer pug](https://github.com/ThatsVie/atlas-headphones/assets/143755961/e1e1c8dd-bbbe-4e9f-8ab4-b7101662c4d8)


In this task, we added a footer to the webpage. The footer contains a logo, social media icons, and a copyright notice. 
**HTML Updates**

The HTML structure for the "Footer" section includes a `<footer>` element with a container for the footer content. Inside this container, there are two main elements: a logo and social media icons. The logo is an image, and the social media icons use custom font icons. Below these elements, there is a paragraph for the copyright notice.

**CSS Updates**

The CSS for the "Footer" section ensures the footer content is centered and spaced appropriately. The layout is made responsive with media queries, adjusting the arrangement of the logo and social media icons for desktop, tablet, and mobile views. The footer text is styled to maintain consistency with the overall design, including font size, color, and opacity.
