## Tasks
### Task 1: Header and Hero Section
For the first task, we created the header and hero section of the webpage.

**HTML**

Header: Includes a logo and navigation links ("What We Do", "Our Results", "Contact Us").

Hero Section: Contains a headline, subheadline, call-to-action button, and a descriptive paragraph.

**CSS**

Variables that define colors, font sizes, and other reusable values.

Base styles set up universal box-sizing, font family, and link styles.

Style the header, logo, and navigation links for different screen sizes.

Style the hero section with background image, text alignment, and spacing.

Responsive Design to ensure the layout adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile views


### Task 2: Create the "What We Do" Section

In this task, we created the "What We do..." section, which highlights key features using custom font icons.

**HTML**

We structured the HTML to include a heading, a description, and four feature blocks. Each feature block contains a custom font icon, a heading, and a description.

**CSS**

We updated the CSS to style the "What We do..." section, ensuring it is responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. The CSS includes styles for the section container, text blocks, and feature blocks, as well as media queries for responsiveness.


### Task 3: "Our Results" Section
For this task, we created the "Our Results" section. The section showcases a background image and pentagon-shaped highlights for the metrics.

**HTML Updates**

The HTML structure for the "Our Results" section includes a container for the section's text and a container for the result blocks. Each result block is styled to maintain a consistent pentagon shape across various screen sizes.

**CSS Updates**

The CSS for the "Our Results" section ensures that the pentagon shapes maintain their form across different screen sizes. This is achieved using a combination of flexbox for layout and careful dimensioning of the result blocks.

### Task 4: Contact Us Section
In this task, we added a "Contact Us" section to the webpage. This section includes a form where users can input their name, email, and a message. The form is designed to be responsive and adjusts its layout for various screen sizes.

### Task 5: Footer Section
In this task, we added a footer to the webpage. The footer contains a logo, social media icons, and a copyright notice. It is designed to be responsive and adjusts its layout for various screen sizes.
