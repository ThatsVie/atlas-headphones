# Atlas - Headphones
This project is a responsive website for a fictional headphones company. The design follows the provided [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/FfnVADRC9xgI3yiZliTBYZ/Holberton-School---Headphone-company?node-id=0-362&t=bJCJPLuaAkLsxogd-0). The website includes a header with navigation links, a hero/banner section, "What we do..." section, "Our results" section, a contact form, and a footer. The design adapts to different screen sizes, including desktop, tablet, and mobile views.

## Tasks
### Task 1: Header and Hero Section
For the first task, we created the header and hero section of the webpage.

**HTML**

Header: Includes a logo and navigation links ("What We Do", "Our Results", "Contact Us").

Hero Section: Contains a headline, subheadline, call-to-action button, and a descriptive paragraph.

**CSS**

Variables that define colors, font sizes, and other reusable values.

Base styles set up universal box-sizing, font family, and link styles.

Style the header, logo, and navigation links for different screen sizes.

Style the hero section with background image, text alignment, and spacing.

Responsive Design to ensure the layout adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile views

### Task 2: Create the "What We Do" Section

In this task, we created the "What We do..." section, which highlights key features using custom font icons.

**HTML**
We structured the HTML to include a heading, a description, and four feature blocks. Each feature block contains a custom font icon, a heading, and a description.

**CSS**
We updated the CSS to style the "What We do..." section, ensuring it is responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. The CSS includes styles for the section container, text blocks, and feature blocks, as well as media queries for responsiveness.
