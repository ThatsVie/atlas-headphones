This project is a responsive website for a fictional headphones company. The design follows the provided [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/FfnVADRC9xgI3yiZliTBYZ/Holberton-School---Headphone-company?node-id=0-362&t=bJCJPLuaAkLsxogd-0). The website includes a header with navigation links, a hero/banner section, "What we do..." section, "Our results" section, a contact form, and a footer. The design adapts to different screen sizes, including desktop, tablet, and mobile views.

### Task 2: Create the "What We Do" Section

In this task, we created the "What We do..." section, which highlights key features using custom font icons.

**HTML**

We structured the HTML to include a heading, a description, and four feature blocks. Each feature block contains a custom font icon, a heading, and a description.

**CSS**

We updated the CSS to style the "What We do..." section, ensuring it is responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. The CSS includes styles for the section container, text blocks, and feature blocks, as well as media queries for responsiveness.

**Mobile View**

### Task 3: "Our Results" Section
For this task, we created the "Our Results" section. The section showcases a background image and pentagon-shaped highlights for the metrics.

**HTML Updates**

The HTML structure for the "Our Results" section includes a container for the section's text and a container for the result blocks. Each result block is styled to maintain a consistent pentagon shape across various screen sizes.

**CSS Updates**

The CSS for the "Our Results" section ensures that the pentagon shapes maintain their form across different screen sizes. This is achieved using a combination of flexbox for layout and careful dimensioning of the result blocks.
